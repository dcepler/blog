[Unofficial Updater 2](https://www.uu-2.download) has been updated (April 11th) to now apply the latest ColdFusion security hotfix [APSB13-10](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb13-10.html) that was released on April 9th.
  
Stay on top of the patching since on April 10th a [Metasploit exploit](http://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2013040074) was released that exploits the previous security hotfix [APSB13-03](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb13-03.html). It is only a matter of time until there is an exploit that goes after the latest security hotfix or the next unknown one.

The best defense is to stay current on patches and properly secure ColdFusion using the published lockdown guides for [ColdFusion 9](http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/coldfusion/pdfs/91025512-cf9-lockdownguide-wp-ue.pdf) or [ColdFusion 10](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/coldfusion/pdfs/cf10/cf10-lockdown-guide.pdf), otherwise.
