Surprise, surprise. I open up my email box and see that the latest [CFDJ](http://sys-con.com/coldfusion/ "ColdFusion Developers Journal") is available. Go scrolling through the articles to find that [Jeff Peters](http://www.grokfusebox.com "Jeff Peters: GrokFusebox") has written a really good article on [LAMBDA Boxes](http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=49181&DE=1 "CFDJ: LAMBDA Boxes"), and further down mentions me and my site. And because I have been busy with a new job and apartment, I haven't updated the site much.

LAMBDA stands for **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **B**lue**D**rgon, **A**pplication. I have been using [BlueDragon](http://www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon/index.cfm "New Atlanta: BlueDragon") since New Atlanta released their betas of 6.1. Most signifcant was the release of Beta 3, where it was possible to run Fusebox 4 on their free server. BlueDragon Server was the perfect fit for me since I wanted to run my site with CFML but had no money to spend on ColdFusion and I could now use the methodology I am most comfortable with.

In March, I gave an updated version of my [LAMBDA presentation](/presentations/lambda.pdf "PDF: LAMBDA Boxes") at the [MDCFUG](http://www.mdcfug.org "Maryland ColdFusion Users Group") which covered BlueDragon 6.1 and has an improved method for running BD as non-root user than what was presented at Fusebox 2004 Conference.

For [CFUNITED](http://www.cfunited.com "The Premier ColdFusion Technical Conference") I have revamped the presentation with quite a bit of new material and it now covers BlueDragon 6.2. I am scheduled to present it Wednesday, June 29th (1st Day) at 4:50-5:40pm (Session 5).
