I have updated [Unofficial Updater 2](https://github.com/dcepler/unofficial-updater2) so it now applies [APSB11-14](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb11-14.html) since it has been out (and subsequently [updated](http://blogs.adobe.com/coldfusion/2011/07/20/june-coldfusion-security-hot-fix-updated/)) for several weeks. The other change to UU2 is that it will now apply patches to ColdFusion 9.0.1 based upon the [matrix](https://github.com/dcepler/unofficial-updater2/blob/master/cf901-hotfix-matrix.pdf?raw=true) of hotfixes.

I still want to see an update mechanism built directly into ColdFusion 10 (Zeus) and this weekend I can talk directly to the Adobe ColdFusion Team at [RIACON](http://www.riacon.com). There is a "**Meet the Team**" session on Saturday, August 6th at 5pm. If you haven't registered and are in the Metro DC area you really should.
