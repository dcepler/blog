I just updated [Unofficial Updater 2](https://github.com/dcepler/unofficial-updater2) to install the latest security bulletin [APSB11-29](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb11-29.html) that Adobe released yesterday. This is pretty much the fastest turn around I have done when Adobe has released a hot fix, due to the fact it was a single file change and hopefully they won't updated it like they have done to the last several. Also I have updated the [wiki](https://github.com/dcepler/unofficial-updater2/wiki/Using-Unofficial-Updater-2) with instructions on how to run it command line and to force text only mode.
