About two weeks back Adobe gave [notice](http://blogs.coldfusion.com/post.cfm/availability-of-coldfusion-9) that you would no longer be able to download a copy of ColdFusion 8 or ColdFusion 9 that contained Verity after May 31, 2012. All the ColdFusion 9 materials are at http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html. 

<div class="well well-sm text-danger">
<strong>Update:</strong> Well, the 9.0.0 installers were there until about 11am EDT May 31st, when they were replaced with the 9.0.2 installers
</div>

Only problem was that I couldn't find the download links for anything ColdFusion 8 for installers or Update 1 as that they are not on [http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html](http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html) or [http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=coldfusion](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=coldfusion).

First stop the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/). I was able to get to an [archive of the download update page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080410151153/http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html) to get ColdFusion 8 Update 1. The links to download are there and do work once you pull off the `http://web.archive.org/web/20080410151153/` from the link. I was able to download all the ColdFusion 8 Update 1 packages and the MD5 hashes match.

Unfortunately, the Wayback Machine was not able to crawl the ColdFusion product download page. This was going to be a bit more work to download the full ColdFusion 8.0.1 installers. Trailing back through my browser cache I was able to pull up a version of the ColdFusion product download page that still showed 8.0.1 downloads with all the information of filename, size, and MD5 hashes.

To download the installers linked below from trials.adobe.com, you need to login to the [ColdFusion product download page](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=coldfusion) first and then click the link below to download the installer you need.

I just used all the links to download all the installers, but they all might really die on June 1. Act fast!
