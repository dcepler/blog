Last night I gave a presentation [Ant Ain\'t Hard](/presentations) to the [Capital Area ColdFusion User Group](http://www.dc-coldfusion.com). It was the first presentation I have done in years for a user group and really enjoyed doing it. I also would like to thank Phill and Sandy for having me present and everyone that was able to attend.

The presentation covers the basics of [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) and demonstrating a simple deployment process using Subversion. It also covers the use of [ant-contrib](http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net) and [Ant Installer](http://antinstaller.sourceforge.net) particularlly how they were used in building [Unofficial Updater 2](https://www.uu-2.download).
